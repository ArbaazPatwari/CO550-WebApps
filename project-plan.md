# Project Plan

*For car purchase web app*

For this CO550 Web Applications module, Team 2 (Arbaaz, Mohammed) will be making a fictitious car selling website for Audi. This web app has multiple features like a database for storing car information, a login and registration system for users to wishlist and add cars to the checkout section. When an admin logs in they will be able to perform CRUD operations like adding new information or removing it. There will be at least 6 cars available on the site, each will be displayed as a card on the store page. Once one option is selected, the user will be taken to a subpage where descriptive information about the car will be shown, including multimedia like images, videos. Our web system will either use MVC or MVVM architecture to for interaction with the database, and may use Razor Pages for structure. CSS styling will likely be done with Bootstrap, which will create responsive elements conveniently and with stability. At least 6 cars will be shown on the website, and we aim to have around 11 pages which consist of: store page, wishlist, checkout, login, sign-up, (6) car pages. As we practise using the C# database-related languages and frameworks, we will be building this software with waterfall methodology in mind.
